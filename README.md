# Lexical-Analyzer

 > Authors: \< [Angela Su](https://github.com/Angela-Su)\>

>For this first part of the class project, we will use the flex tool to generate a lexical analyzer for a high-level source code language called "MINI-L". The lexical analyzer should take as input a MINI-L program, parse it, and output the sequence of lexical tokens associated with the program.
